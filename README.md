# Week0 - Project1

## Project Description
You are going to be emulating a content managment system by controlling the content in the JavaScript file instead of the HTML file. This project is an excercise pointed at selecting elements and then updating them without touching the HTML file using the DOM.

You have been provided a [JSON object](js/index.js) with all the necessary data to accomplish this task.

**IMPORTANT: You cannot update the HTML or CSS files directly.  You must use JavaScript and the DOM only for that.**

## Task 

* Update the HTML with the JSON data using DOM manipulation ONLY.
* Change the color of the navigation text to be green.
* add two new items to the navigation system. You can call them whatever you want.
## Stretch Goals

* Try to integrate a button that can update content on the site with a click of a button.  You could build a similar data object with new values to help you test the click event.
